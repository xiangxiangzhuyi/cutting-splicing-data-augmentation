cutting-splicing data augmentation (CS-DA): a novel technology for medical image segmentation

Medical images are more difficult to acquire and annotate than natural images, which makes data augmentation technologies often used in medical image segmentation tasks. Most data augmentation technologies used in medical segmentation are originally developed on natural images and don’t take into account the characteristic that the overall layout of medical images is standard and fixed. Based on the characteristics of medical images, we developed the cutting-splicing data augmentation (CS-DA), a novel data augmentation technology for medical image segmentation. CS-DA augments the dataset by splicing different position components cut from different original medical images into a new image. The characteristic of the medical image makes the new image have the same layout and similar appearance as the original image. Compared with classical data augmentation technologies, CS-DA is more simple and more robust. Moreover, CS-DA doesn’t introduce any noise or fake information into the new created image.

There are two versions of CS-DA: 2D, and 3D. The two versions have the same structure.
